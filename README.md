Hello world! This is my website. The purpose of this website is to help employers find me and to provide them with links to some of my other accounts across the internet.

Current version does not actually implement any `bootstrap`, although it is still included in the `.html` files. Its inclusion is an artifact/relic of older designs. 

It was fun practice in using `jQuery`, `javascript`, and not so fun practice in trying to center `<div>`s in `html` and `css`, but I am happy with how far I've gotten thus far. 

As long as there are still `issues` in this repository, then this website will be a work in progress.

Hope you like it (so far)!
