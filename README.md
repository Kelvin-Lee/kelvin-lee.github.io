Hello world! This is my website. The purpose of this website is to help employers find me and to provide them with links to some of my other accounts across the internet.

Current version does not actually use any of the files in the `/images` directory, nor does it utilize any `bootstrap`. Both the directory and the inclusion of `bootstrap` are relics of older designs.

It was fun practice in using `jQuery`, `javascript`, and not so fun practice in trying to center `<div>`s in `html` and `css`, but I am happy with how far I've gotten thus far.

Hope you like it!
